# Study Abroad Database Driven Application

This was my final project for my Database Theory and Practice class. It is a Study Abroad Database Driven Application, for which I utilized MySQL to create and manage the database, and Eclipse IDE to develop an application using Java that could use it. This project included several phases of designing and implementing the database and developing the actual application for its use. It was intended to be worked on simultaneously with the rest of the course's classes and assignments.

#### Overview
The database manages the complete lifecycle of study abroad programs, from program creation and session management to student applications and enrollment tracking. It supports multiple user roles including students, study abroad office staff, and program administrators.

#### Key Features
- Multi-role user authentication and authorization system
- Comprehensive program and session management
- Student application processing with status tracking
- Automated eligibility verification (GPA, language requirements)
- Enrollment management with capacity controls
- Academic record integration

#### Technical Implementation
- Role-based access control through database triggers and constraints
- Comprehensive data validation and integrity checks
- Transaction management for concurrent operations
- Normalized database schema (BCNF compliant)
- Stored procedures for secure data modifications
- Views for efficient data access and security

#### Files

The uploaded files include a Word document containing all the database specifications and, ultimately, the application's front and back-end specifications. The folder also includes all the .java files necessary for setting up the application. This project was intended to demonstrate and apply database-related concepts, so the application contains only basic features to demonstrate database functionality.

**Note:**

For this project, our professor managed our MySQL accounts. I modified the original code, specifically in the Database.java class, not to include these credentials to maintain confidentiality.
